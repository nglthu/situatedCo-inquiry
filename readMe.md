# Aim of this project

The aim of this project is to build up experience and skills in having user perspectives, preferences, and behaviours inform the design of a computer-based system.

# Core idea

+ To spend the majority of efforts in building up detailed and
accurate descriptions of the users and their usage. Getting full descriptions of users from their life goals down to daily habits can all be highly useful. 

+ Demonstrate how these descriptions informed and guided the design of the system. 

# Design

The design may contain potential bugs or unfavorable usage to practice and serve the core idea.
